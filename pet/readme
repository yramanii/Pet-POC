Here are some useful commands to setup your project environment.

For Running project,

1. In linux,
    => in terminal,
    1.  setup virtual environment,
        " pip install virtualenv "
        " virtualenv <name of env> (like "venv") "
    
    2. enter into virtualenv,
        " source venv/bin/activate "
    
    3. install reuirements,
        " pip install -r requirements.txt "

    4. Do migrations to setup Database,
        1. " falsk db init "
        2. " flask db migrate -m 'first migration' " 
        3. " flask db upgrade "

        after this go to your terminal and write,
        " pyhton "
        
        inside interpriter,
        " from pet import db "
        " from pet.models import Category "
        " c1 = Category(name='Seller') "
        " c2 = Category(name='Buyer') "
        " db.session.add_all([c1,c2]) "
        " db.session.commit() "

        Done. press " ctrl + z " to exit from terminal.
    
    5. set your flask app in environment,
        " export FLASK_APP='pet' " (make sure you put main "pet" directory inside one directory like I put.)
        " export FLASK_DEBUG=1 " ( optional )
    
    6. run your app,
        " flask run ".

2. In Windows,

    => step no. 1,3,4 and 6 are same.
    => changes,
    
    2. enter into virtualenv,
        " venv/Scripts/activate "
    
    4. set your flask app into environment,
        " set FLASK_APP='pet' "
        " set FLASK_DEBUG=1 "

That's It.
